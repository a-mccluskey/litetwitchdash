# litetwitchdash
a lightweight twitch dashboard for streamers that dont like having messages for them in their chat. alternatively for non streamers to 
keep track of a few details of their games and to stay healthy :-)

Ideally should sit in just a html file, buit should be expandable to place on either a local webserver or on anther server as required.

will have the following:
stay hydrated - take a drink every 15 mins
20-20-20 - look away from the computer for 20 seconds
stretch - once an hour stand up
chat window - rather than load the dashboard
WLD - for competitive games, export to external file for viewers to see the current score.
