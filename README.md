# litetwitchdash V0.2
a lightweight twitch dashboard for streamers that dont like having messages for them in their chat. alternatively for non streamers to 
keep track of a few details of their games and to stay healthy :-)

Ideally should sit in just a html file, buit should be expandable to place on either a local webserver or on anther server as required.

Has the following:
stay hydrated - take a drink every 5 mins
20-20-20 - look away from the computer every 20 mins
stretch - once an hour stand up
Arrow changes to red in the last 10percent of each section



Still to be put in:
Buttons under each dial to reset the counter, can be done before the end of the counter.
chat window - rather than load the dashboard
WLD - for competitive games, export to external file for viewers to see the current score.
